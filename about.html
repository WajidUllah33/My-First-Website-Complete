<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>Al-Hamdollilah! By the grace of Allah, this organization is serving the<br>
 poor and the distressed people of our society since 5th May 1999. We are a part of a society where<br>
 the majority of the people residing in villages and towns are living below the poverty<br>
 line and even deprived of the basic necessities of life.</p>
<br>
<p>Now let us take a look at the life of the people living in cities, where unfortunately living<br>
conditions are not much different. If we examine their family size, we find a very painful<br>
situation, where in a small rented house the husband and the wife with their four<br>
children survive with a very low earning.</p>
<br>
<p>In today’s world where inflation is at its peak, it is impossible for them to pay for their<br>
electricity, children’s education and any medical treatment of any family member.</p>
<br>
<p>How will the head of the family be able to provide for the needs of his children?? The<br>
result: he takes loans. He is not to be blamed because he is responsible to provide<br>
three meals a day for his family and he is forced to use the wrong means to fulfill his<br>
family’s needs.</p>
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly, the poor and the needy are helpless. Our organization spends time with <br>
them and is fully aware of their problems and weaknesses. Therefore we want to help <br>
them in such a way that all financial aid is free from interest. In view of all the <br>
difficulties faced by the poor, Saylani Welfare International Trust has organized 63 <br>
different sectors to sort out the problems of the ones who are in need. These <br>
departments are efficiently working for the cause of the society.</p>
<br>
<p>By the Grace of the Almighty Allah, it can be proudly said that this organization has <br>
become a back-bone of the poor society and provides help after a complete inquiry <br>
survey. This organization receives aid from different parts of the world. Each and every <br>
penny is spent after a strict inquiry and a utilization report is delivered to those who <br>
send this aid to us. In this report, addresses of the people to whom these donations <br>
have been given, is mentioned with details. This shows that your money has been given <br>
to the right people. You can also contact these people with the help of their addresses <br>
and get a confirmation whether the organization has provided them with the aid and if <br>
they are really the ones who deserve. In a way, your sadaqa or zakaat is being spent <br>
with your own hands. Our aim is to inquire and survey to find the ones who need us.</p>
